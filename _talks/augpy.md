This talk was intended to be an introduction to Augmented Reality, focusing on its basic priciples, and how we can draw insights from the well established field of computer vision. I also showcased a python-based library, [AugPy](https://github.com/itssmutnuri/AugPy) with a simple goal of showing a (badly rendered) 3D model on top of a book (for the interested its Carl Sagan's Contact). The repo now lies unmaintained.

A detailed motivation is presented in the [Talk Proposal](https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2019/proposals/exploring-augmented-reality-with-python~e0rKb/).
