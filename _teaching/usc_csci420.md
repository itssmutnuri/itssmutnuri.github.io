Worked as a Course Producer for the undergraduate level course in Computer Graphics, taught by [Prof. Andrew Nealan](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Nealen/Andrew) during Fall 2022. This course is an introduction to the theory and programming for 3D computer graphics using basic OpenGL, intended for seniors and first-year graduate students.

As a CP, I conducted regular office hours, providing personalized support and mentorship to students.  I actively guided students through their assignments, which involved clarifying complex concepts, troubleshooting programming challenges and encouraging critical thinking to problem-solving in computer graphics.
